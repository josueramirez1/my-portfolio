        <h3>Background and Projects</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          I received a Master of Science in Special Education in 2018 and have
          taught over 100 students with disabilities of varying degrees. With
          this background, I have developed a strong desire to use my creativity
          to build applications and experiences that improve people's everyday lives—especially
          for those who require further support and/or accessibility to access
          content.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Below is a list of some projects I've worked on from easiest to
          difficult.
